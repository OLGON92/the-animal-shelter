<body>
  <p>Welcome to Chet's animal shelter. Our mission started when our founder Chet Elderson found a stray cat named Josiah on the side of the road. At first he wasn't a fan of animals at all, but Josiah helped him change his mind. Ever since then Chet has been running his own animal shelter.</p>

    <p>Derek the Amazing Beagle is medium-sized brown beagle that joined our shleter after being abandoned in a box behind the local mini-mart. He is Amazing because of his keen sense of smell and because of the almost einstein-like level of intelligence he posseses. He absolutely loves being around people, other dogs, and children. Adopt him while you can!</p></div>

    <p>Domino the Super Pony is a black and white pony, hence the name Domino, that came into our shelter after her original owner could no-longer care for her. She is Super fast and agile. She absolutely loves the occasional sugar-cube or two. She loves all types of people and could use a good home. </p></div>
